Especially for iPad, a mobile device, it is rather often to encounter the case when we want to clone the repository down, make some quick fixes, and push back to remote repository. You may want to check out issues and pull requests on your mobile device, or scan through some others codes on GitHub. Well, these apps may help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"github-for-ios\">GitHub for iOS<a href=\"#github-for-ios\" title=\"GitHub for iOS\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/893cebd99b3d2.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"github.png\"></p>\n<p>Before GitHub app is finally published on iOS App Store March this year,  <code>GitHawk for GitHub</code> and <code>DevHub for GitHub</code> were once choices for developers who have the need to reply to issues and pull requests at hand. Yet, the official app certainly do better jobs. Programmers are able to gain similar experience where they do in browsers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-copy\">Working Copy<a href=\"#working-copy\" title=\"Working Copy\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/00e082f32166f.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Working_Copy.png\"></p>\n<p><code>Working Copy</code> , quotes from its website,  is “a powerful Git client for iOS that clones, edits, commits, pushes &amp; more.” </p>\n<p>You can initialize a git repository on your iPad locally. If you go check out the files, you will find a <code>.git</code> directory.  Projects can also be cloned from GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or even your private remote repository. Pushing, pulling, committing, merging, reverting, branch checkout… All common git commands can be achieved with <code>Working Copy</code>.  It allows users to simple edit and create files as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/b7f48a82e24ba.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Copy_Features.png\"></p>\n<p>It can work perfectly with GitHub app and code editor <code>Textastic</code>, Swift’s <code>playground</code> and Python’s <code>Pythonista</code>.</p>\n<p> Check out more usage at this user guide: <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/manual.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://workingcopyapp.com/manual.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"idecode-editor\">IDE/Code Editor<a href=\"#idecode-editor\" title=\"IDE/Code Editor\"></a></h2><p>In fact there are many code editor apps. Yet, most of them run your codes on remote servers instead of under your local iPad environment, and thus a steady Internet connection is required. It’s understandable, considering Apple’s restrictive policy matter.  Nevertheless, some apps <em>do</em> run codes offline.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pythonista\">Pythonista<a href=\"#pythonista\" title=\"Pythonista\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/c9a177ff5b4ba.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"pythonista.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Pythonista</em> is a Python IDE on iOS. Unlike many other similar apps, it allows programmers to import modules. </p>\n<p>&lt;— To Be Continued</p>\n","next":{"title":"Spring Session Note","link":"2020/04/24/Spring-Session-Note"},"plink":"https://git.michaelsblog.top/2020/04/29/Tool/","toc":[{"id":"git","title":"Git","index":"1","children":[{"id":"github-for-ios","title":"GitHub for iOS","index":"1.1"},{"id":"working-copy","title":"Working Copy","index":"1.2"}]},{"id":"idecode-editor","title":"IDE&#x2F;Code Editor","index":"2","children":[{"id":"pythonista","title":"Pythonista","index":"2.1"}]}]}
