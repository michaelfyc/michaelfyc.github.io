Especially for iPad, a mobile device, it is rather often to encounter the case when we want to clone the repository down, make some quick fixes, and push back to remote repository. You may want to check out issues and pull requests on your mobile device, or scan through some others codes on GitHub. Well, these apps may help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"github-for-ios\">GitHub for iOS<a href=\"#github-for-ios\" title=\"GitHub for iOS\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/893cebd99b3d2.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"github.png\"></p>\n<p>Before GitHub app is finally published on iOS App Store March this year,  <code>GitHawk for GitHub</code> and <code>DevHub for GitHub</code> were once choices for developers who have the need to reply to issues and pull requests at hand. Yet, the official app certainly do better jobs. Programmers are able to gain similar experience where they do in browsers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-copy\">Working Copy<a href=\"#working-copy\" title=\"Working Copy\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/00e082f32166f.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Working_Copy.png\"></p>\n<p><code>Working Copy</code> , quotes from its website,  is “a powerful Git client for iOS that clones, edits, commits, pushes &amp; more.” </p>\n<p>You can initialize a git repository on your iPad locally. If you go check out the files, you will find a <code>.git</code> directory.  Projects can also be cloned from GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or even your private remote repository. Pushing, pulling, committing, merging, reverting, branch checkout… All common git commands can be achieved with <code>Working Copy</code>.  It allows users to simple edit and create files as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/b7f48a82e24ba.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Copy_Features.png\"></p>\n<p>It can work perfectly with GitHub app and code editor <code>Textastic</code>, Swift’s <code>playground</code> and Python’s <code>Pythonista</code>.</p>\n<p> Check out more usage at this user guide: <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/manual.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://workingcopyapp.com/manual.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"idecode-editor\">IDE/Code Editor<a href=\"#idecode-editor\" title=\"IDE/Code Editor\"></a></h2><p>In fact there are many code editor apps. Yet, most of them run your codes on remote servers instead of under your local iPad environment, and thus a steady Internet connection is required. It’s understandable, considering Apple’s restrictive policy matter.  Nevertheless, some apps <em>do</em> run codes offline.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pythonista\">Pythonista<a href=\"#pythonista\" title=\"Pythonista\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/c9a177ff5b4ba.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"pythonista.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Pythonista</em> is a Python IDE on iOS. Unlike many other similar apps, it allows programmers to import modules like <code>requests</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>matplotlib</code> , you name it! From games to animations, to user interface and automation scripts, Pythonista can be entitled as the best Python IDE on iOS.  The only problem is, web frameworks, <code>django</code> and <code>flask</code> for instance, are not available. </p>\n<p>Pythonista is a paid app, but it really worth the price.</p>\n<h3 id=\"juno-for-jupyter-carnets\">Juno for Jupyter/ Carnets<a href=\"#juno-for-jupyter-carnets\" title=\"Juno for Jupyter/ Carnets\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/1662941ad268f.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Juno.JPG\"></p>\n<p><em>Juno for Jupyter</em> is a complete Jupyter development environment for iOS devices. You can run notebooks locally using embedded Python kernel and integrated libraries. Juno app is sold at $14.99. If bundled with Juno Connect, a client app for Jupyter on cloud, the whole package costs $19.99.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/2af8079c1880b.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Carnets.JPG\"></p>\n<p><em>Carnets</em> is another Jupyter notebook environment on iOS devices. Compared to Juno, it is less powerful, but it should fulfill the basic needs. In addition, Carnets is FREE. You can find the source code of Carnets at <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"playgrounds\">Playgrounds<a href=\"#playgrounds\" title=\"Playgrounds\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/98e481793021f.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"playgrounds.JPG\"></p>\n<p><em>Playgrounds</em> is a Swift learning app published by Apple official, and thus best suits iOS environment. There are cool lessons and games for beginners to learn Swift.</p>\n<h3 id=\"playjs-jsbox\">Play.js/ JSBox<a href=\"#playjs-jsbox\" title=\"Play.js/ JSBox\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/a34e1a6996f3f.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"playjs.JPG\"></p>\n<p><em>Play.js</em>(pronounced in “Play dot js”), is a Node.js IDE for iOS devices. It allows users to clone remote repositories, install Node.js modules in <code>package.json</code> with npm. It even supports hot-reload and real-time preview. The only thing that frustrates me is that you have to rename the <code>main.js</code> to <code>index.js</code> as the entry point of my Vue project. It charges $4.99.</p>\n<p><em>JSBox</em>, is another popular JavaScript IDE. It supports themes, auto-completion and snippets. It also includes linter,prettier and database viewer(with SQLite). The most fascinating part is that JSBox works well with native iOS. You can create a work-flow of automation with iOS <em>shortcuts</em> and JavaScript in JSBox. JSBox is free for trial. For Node.js, dark theme and other pro-features, subscribe JSBox for $7.99 per year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"textastic-code-editor-9--koder-code-editor\">Textastic Code Editor 9/  Koder Code Editor<a href=\"#textastic-code-editor-9--koder-code-editor\" title=\"Textastic Code Editor 9/  Koder Code Editor\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/ac6763df4f885.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"textastic.JPG\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/df201d01bb483.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"Koder.JPG\"></p>\n<p>These two are code editors instead of IDE. Textastic allows users to pull files with git, while Koder does not. Textastic also supports auto-completion for HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Both Textastic and Koder supports syntax highlighting, markup languages, SFTP, SSH, and WebDAV services. The former charges $9.99, the latter charges $5.99 as in-app purchase. </p>\n<p>&lt;– To Be Continued</p>\n","next":{"title":"Spring Session Note","link":"2020/04/24/Spring-Session-Note"},"plink":"https://git.michaelsblog.top/2020/04/29/Tool/","toc":[{"id":"git","title":"Git","index":"1","children":[{"id":"github-for-ios","title":"GitHub for iOS","index":"1.1"},{"id":"working-copy","title":"Working Copy","index":"1.2"}]},{"id":"idecode-editor","title":"IDE&#x2F;Code Editor","index":"2","children":[{"id":"pythonista","title":"Pythonista","index":"2.1"},{"id":"juno-for-jupyter-carnets","title":"Juno for Jupyter&#x2F; Carnets","index":"2.2"},{"id":"playgrounds","title":"Playgrounds","index":"2.3"},{"id":"playjs-jsbox","title":"Play.js&#x2F; JSBox","index":"2.4"},{"id":"textastic-code-editor-9--koder-code-editor","title":"Textastic Code Editor 9&#x2F;  Koder Code Editor","index":"2.5"}]}]}
