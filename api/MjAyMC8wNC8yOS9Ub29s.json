You do not need to jailbreak to download them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"git\">Git<a href=\"#git\" title=\"Git\"></a></h2><p>Version control is always a big thing in programming. Especially for iPad, a mobile device, it is rather often to encounter the case when we want to clone the repository down, make some quick fixes, and push back to remote repository. You may want to check out issues and pull requests on your mobile device, or scan through some others codes on GitHub. Well, these apps may help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"github-for-ios\">GitHub for iOS<a href=\"#github-for-ios\" title=\"GitHub for iOS\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/893cebd99b3d2.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"github.png\" style=\"zoom:67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Before GitHub app is finally published on iOS App Store March this year,  <code>GitHawk for GitHub</code> and <code>DevHub for GitHub</code> were once choices for developers who have the need to reply to issues and pull requests at hand. Yet, the official app certainly do better jobs. Programmers are able to gain similar experience where they do in browsers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-copy\">Working Copy<a href=\"#working-copy\" title=\"Working Copy\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/00e082f32166f.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Working_Copy.png\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Working Copy</em> , quotes from its website,  is “a powerful Git client for iOS that clones, edits, commits, pushes &amp; more.” </p>\n<p>You can initialize a git repository on your iPad locally. If you go check out the files, you will find a <code>.git</code> directory.  Projects can also be cloned from GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or even your private remote repository. Pushing, pulling, committing, merging, reverting, branch checkout… All common git commands can be achieved with <code>Working Copy</code>.  It allows users to simple edit and create files as well.</p>\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/b7f48a82e24ba.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Copy_Features.png\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n<p>It can work perfectly with GitHub app and code editor <code>Textastic</code>, Swift’s <code>playground</code> and Python’s <code>Pythonista</code>.</p>\n<p> Check out more usage at this user guide: <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/manual.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://workingcopyapp.com/manual.html</a>. It charges $3.99 for pro-features. You can still get that for free if you have applied for GitHub Student Pack, though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"idecode-editor\">IDE/Code Editor<a href=\"#idecode-editor\" title=\"IDE/Code Editor\"></a></h2><p>In fact there are many code editor apps. Yet, most of them run your codes on remote servers instead of under your local iPad environment, and thus a steady Internet connection is required. It’s understandable, considering Apple’s restrictive policy matter.  Nevertheless, some apps <em>do</em> run codes offline.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pythonista\">Pythonista<a href=\"#pythonista\" title=\"Pythonista\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/29/c9a177ff5b4ba.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"pythonista.png\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pythonista</em> is a Python IDE on iOS. Unlike many other similar apps, it allows programmers to import modules like <code>requests</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>matplotlib</code> , you name it! From games to animations, to user interface and automation scripts, Pythonista can be entitled as the best Python IDE on iOS.  The only problem is, web frameworks, <code>django</code> and <code>flask</code> for instance, are not available. </p>\n<p>Pythonista is a paid app, but it really worth the price.</p>\n<h3 id=\"juno-for-jupyter-carnets\">Juno for Jupyter/ Carnets<a href=\"#juno-for-jupyter-carnets\" title=\"Juno for Jupyter/ Carnets\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/1662941ad268f.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Juno.JPG\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n<p><em>Juno for Jupyter</em> is a complete Jupyter development environment for iOS devices. You can run notebooks locally using embedded Python kernel and integrated libraries. Juno app is sold at $14.99. If bundled with Juno Connect, a client app for Jupyter on cloud, the whole package costs $19.99.</p>\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/2af8079c1880b.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Carnets.JPG\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n<p><em>Carnets</em> is another Jupyter notebook environment on iOS devices. Compared to Juno, it is less powerful, but it should fulfill the basic needs. In addition, Carnets is FREE. You can find the source code of Carnets at <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/holzschu/Carnets</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"playgrounds\">Playgrounds<a href=\"#playgrounds\" title=\"Playgrounds\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/98e481793021f.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"playgrounds.JPG\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Playgrounds* is a Swift learning app published by Apple official, and thus best suits iOS environment. There are cool lessons and games for beginners to learn Swift.</p>\n<h3 id=\"playjs-jsbox\">Play.js/ JSBox<a href=\"#playjs-jsbox\" title=\"Play.js/ JSBox\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/a34e1a6996f3f.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"playjs.JPG\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Play.js</em>(pronounced in “Play dot js”), is a Node.js IDE for iOS devices. It allows users to clone remote repositories, install Node.js modules in <code>package.json</code> with npm. It even supports hot-reload and real-time preview. The only thing that frustrates me is that you have to rename the <code>main.js</code> to <code>index.js</code> as the entry point of my Vue project. It charges $4.99.</p>\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/05/02/884e6a3240ab9.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"JSBox.jpg\" style=\"zoom: 50%;\" />\n\n<p><em>JSBox</em>, is another popular JavaScript IDE. It supports themes, auto-completion and snippets. It also includes linter,prettier and database viewer(with SQLite). The most fascinating part is that JSBox works well with native iOS. You can create a work-flow of automation with iOS <em>shortcuts</em> and JavaScript in JSBox. JSBox is free for trial. For Node.js, dark theme and other pro-features, subscribe JSBox for $7.99 per year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"textastic-code-editor-9--koder-code-editor\">Textastic Code Editor 9/  Koder Code Editor<a href=\"#textastic-code-editor-9--koder-code-editor\" title=\"Textastic Code Editor 9/  Koder Code Editor\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/ac6763df4f885.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"textastic.JPG\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/df201d01bb483.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Koder.JPG\" style=\"zoom:67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p>These two are code editors instead of IDE. Textastic allows users to pull files with git, while Koder does not. Textastic also supports auto-completion for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Both Textastic and Koder supports syntax highlighting, markup languages, SFTP, SSH, and WebDAV services. The former charges $9.99, the latter charges $5.99 as in-app purchase. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sshshell\">SSH/Shell<a href=\"#sshshell\" title=\"SSH/Shell\"></a></h2><h3 id=\"termius\">Termius<a href=\"#termius\" title=\"Termius\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/667bc77de5b8b.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"termius.jpg\"></p>\n<p><em>Termius</em>, in my personal opinion, is the best SSH client, now available on MacOS, Windows and iOS. Its theme and outlook are just to my taste. With GitHub Student Pack, you can unlock some pro-features of Termius like <code>fstp</code> and data syncing.</p>\n<p>Check it out at <a href=\"https://www.termius.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.termius.com/</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ish\">iSH<a href=\"#ish\" title=\"iSH\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/9cca7cf373431.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"ish.JPG\"></p>\n<p><em>iSH</em> simulates an Alpine Linux on iOS devices locally, which allows you to install packages with Alpine Package Manager <code>apk</code> and to run codes of several languages., including C/C++,Python, Perl. The latest version now even supports Java and Golang. I managed to run a simple HTTP server on local using python and golang. The coding experience is just like that you have on a primitive Linux, except for lacking the assistance from IDE. The app is still under test-flight now and many places still need improving. Visit <a href=\"https://ish.app\" target=\"_blank\">https://ish.app</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ish-app/ish\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ish-app/ish</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blink-shell-a-shell\">Blink Shell/ a-shell<a href=\"#blink-shell-a-shell\" title=\"Blink Shell/ a-shell\"></a></h3><p><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/884ad04f4457e.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" class=\"φcy\" alt=\"blink.JPG\"></p>\n<p><em>Blink Shell</em> is a (Mosh)[<a href=\"https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh]\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh]</a> and SSH client for iOS. It’s open-source and repository can be found (here)[<a href=\"https://github.com/blinksh/blink]\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/blinksh/blink]</a>. Mosh, like Zsh and Bash, is a shell language designed particularly for mobile devices. The only shortcoming of Blink Shell to me is that it charges $19.99.</p>\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/909054b824ccd.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"a-shell.JPG\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/04/30/7b272fc00b72d.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"a-shell-description.JPG\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>a-shell</em> is a terminal for iOS which supports partial Linux command and has integrated Python, Javascript, C/C++, and Lua environment inside. You can freely pip install and gcc compile. <em>a-shell</em> is open-source either. It’s less popular than Blink Shell, but it’s free! If you go visit the repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell</a>, you’ll discover that the author of <em>a-shell</em> is the same one of <em>Carnets</em>, as mentioned above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"others\">Others<a href=\"#others\" title=\"Others\"></a></h2><h3 id=\"dash\">Dash<a href=\"#dash\" title=\"Dash\"></a></h3><p><em>Dash</em> is an app that enables you to download documents of popular languages, libraries, tools and frameworks to your devices so that you can read them off-line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bear-mweb\">Bear/ MWeb<a href=\"#bear-mweb\" title=\"Bear/ MWeb\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/05/03/9f1dd22a02fd4.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"bear.JPG\" style=\"zoom:67%;\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/05/03/b2797282c57de.png?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"bear-ipad-screenshot.png\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n<p><em>Bear</em> and <em>MWeb</em>  are text-editor that supports Markdown. <em>MWeb</em> allows you to export your markdown files into PDF and publish as HTML. Both these apps have MacOS version, making syncing easier.</p>\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/05/03/76eb77e676269.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Mweb.JPG\" style=\"zoom:67%;\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/05/03/653fb5850bf8e.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"Mweb_feature.JPG\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\n\n<h3 id=\"shortcuts\">Shortcuts<a href=\"#shortcuts\" title=\"Shortcuts\"></a></h3><img src=\"https://img.cdn.n3ko.co/lsky/2020/05/03/8f58d174686d9.jpg?x-oss-process=image/auto-orient,1/quality,q_70/sharpen,200/format,webp\" alt=\"ios12-iphone-x-shortcuts-gallery.jpg\" style=\"zoom: 50%;\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Shortcuts is pre-installed on new iOS devices now. Users can design their work-flow and without or with little programming knowledge. For those who know little coding common work-flow can be downloaded from gallery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ending\">Ending<a href=\"#ending\" title=\"Ending\"></a></h3><p>All of these apps mentioned above can be found in either App Store or Testflight, and require no jailbreak or IPA self-signing. Have to say, iPad as a developer tools is barely satisfying. Hope that one day iPad can be a real substitution of MacBook for programmers.</p>\n","prev":{"title":"MyBatis Java Annotation Dealing with Complicated Objects","link":"2020/08/01/MyBatis-Java-Annotation"},"next":{"title":"Spring Session Note","link":"2020/04/24/Spring-Session-Note"},"plink":"https://git.michaelsblog.top/2020/04/29/Tool/","toc":[{"id":"git","title":"Git","index":"1","children":[{"id":"github-for-ios","title":"GitHub for iOS","index":"1.1"},{"id":"working-copy","title":"Working Copy","index":"1.2"}]},{"id":"idecode-editor","title":"IDE&#x2F;Code Editor","index":"2","children":[{"id":"pythonista","title":"Pythonista","index":"2.1"},{"id":"juno-for-jupyter-carnets","title":"Juno for Jupyter&#x2F; Carnets","index":"2.2"},{"id":"playgrounds","title":"Playgrounds","index":"2.3"},{"id":"playjs-jsbox","title":"Play.js&#x2F; JSBox","index":"2.4"},{"id":"textastic-code-editor-9--koder-code-editor","title":"Textastic Code Editor 9&#x2F;  Koder Code Editor","index":"2.5"}]},{"id":"sshshell","title":"SSH&#x2F;Shell","index":"3","children":[{"id":"termius","title":"Termius","index":"3.1"},{"id":"ish","title":"iSH","index":"3.2"},{"id":"blink-shell-a-shell","title":"Blink Shell&#x2F; a-shell","index":"3.3"}]},{"id":"others","title":"Others","index":"4","children":[{"id":"dash","title":"Dash","index":"4.1"},{"id":"bear-mweb","title":"Bear&#x2F; MWeb","index":"4.2"},{"id":"shortcuts","title":"Shortcuts","index":"4.3"},{"id":"ending","title":"Ending","index":"4.4"}]}]}
